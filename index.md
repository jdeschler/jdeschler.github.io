## About Me

I am a joint JD/PhD student at Harvard Law School (expected graduation 2026, 1L completed) and the Harvard Kennedy School (Public Policy program, Politics and Institutions Track). I've always searched for the intersections in his academic career. As an undergraduate, I combined computer and political science, and now, between HKS and Harvard Law, I hopes to toe the line between political science and legal research. I am fascinated by the vast number of unanswered legal questions that political scientists have the tools to answer, and hope to use my training in both disciplines to further understand the American legal system. I aim to teach law from an empirical perspective, hoping to broaden the statistical knowledge of the legal profession on a larger scale.

I hold a B.A. from Harvard College in Computer Science and Government, with a secondary in Energy and Environment. Along with my JD and PhD, I am pursuing a Masters in Statistics. I am an active member of the [Harvard Journal on Legislation](https://harvardjol.com), serving as an Exectutive Articles Editor for Volumes 60 and 61. I coordinate the Kennedy School PhD Students Association mentoring program for incoming G1 students, and play for the Harvard Law School soccer team in a Boston-area graduate school league. Outside of school, I coach youth rock climbing at Boston Bouldering Project, and play competitive ultimate frisbee for Boston League of Shadows.

My previous experience includes a variety of research and teaching positions (listed below). Between college and graduate school, I worked for the Voter Protection Corps, the Michigan Democratic Party during the 2020 campaign, and then on the redistricting process at the [Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group](https://mggg.org). After my first year of law school, I interned at the solicitor's office in the Department of the Interior.

## Research Interests

- **Judicial Politics:** appointments, retirements, polarization
- **Judicial Decisionmaking:** tracking the effects of decisions, 
- **Empirical Legal Studies:** jurisdictional boundaries, judicial administration, models of American courts

My research experience includes work with Professors Maya Sen (HKS), Justin de Benedictness Kessner (HKS), Larry Schwartztol (HLS), Jim Waldo (Harvard Computer Science/HKS) and the Harvard Environmental and Energy Law Program.
